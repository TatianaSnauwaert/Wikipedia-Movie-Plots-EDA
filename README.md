## Wikipedia-Movie-Plots-EDA
Exploratory data analysis based on the Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset

In this kernel I am performing an exploratory data analysis of plot summary descriptions scraped from Wikipedia.

The dataset iteslf can be found on this link: [*Wikipedia Movie Plots* dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots).

### Dataset content
The dataset contains descriptions of 34,886 movies from around the world. Column descriptions are listed below:

Release Year - Year in which the movie was released
Title - Movie title
Origin/Ethnicity - Origin of movie (i.e. American, Bollywood, Tamil, etc.)
Director - Director(s)
Plot - Main actor and actresses
Genre - Movie Genre(s)
Wiki Page - URL of the Wikipedia page from which the plot description was scraped
Plot - Long form description of movie plot (WARNING: May contain spoilers!!!)

In the jupyter notebook I am exploring data in the following ways:
- overall trend in movie releases over the years around the world;
- total number of movies released per ethnicity over the years (1900-2020);
- Focus on the 2 industry leaders: The US and India;
- most popular movie genres in different countries;
- top movie directors and cast.
